# ☁️ Cloud-Based Trade Scaling System (for Futures Trading)

## 🎯 Objective

Build a **cloud-based Trade Scaling Software** inspired by the provided architecture diagram — designed for **futures traders** who require **real-time trade mirroring, transparency, and scalability**.

---

## 🌐 System Overview

Develop a **modular, cloud-native trade scaling system** that enables seamless, real-time mirroring and scaling of trades across multiple accounts and trading platforms:

- **MT4 / MT5**
- **cTrader**
- **DXTrade** *(Future)*
- **TradeLocker** *(Future)*
- **Match-Trader** *(Future)*

The architecture should follow the provided diagram, emphasizing **speed**, **reliability**, and **flexibility**.

## 🧩 Core Components

### 1. 🧠 Core Module
- Acts as the **main processing and coordination hub**.
- Manages **account data**, **session handling**, and **inter-process communication (IPC)** with the *Diagram Overview Map Editor App*.
- Interfaces with **Connectors** for execution and logging.
- Handles **strategy-level logic** and **trade routing decisions**.

---

### 2. 🔌 Connectors
- Integrate directly with **broker APIs**:
  - MT4/MT5 API  
  - cTrader API  
  - DXTrade API *(Future)*  
  - TradeLocker API *(Future)*  
  - Match-Trader API *(Future)*  
- Translate internal trade instructions to **broker-native API calls**.
- Ensure **multi-platform compatibility** and **high-frequency execution**.

---

### 3. 🖥️ Manual Order Management
Receives trade signals from multiple sources:
- Manual Trade Input  
- Signal Providers  
- REST API  
- Filedrop (CSV / JSON)  
- Algo Trading (1-Leg / 2-Leg HFT)  
- Webhooks (TradingView, MT4/MT5 EA, Telegram-to-Mirror App)  

Normalizes and routes orders to connected accounts through the **Core**.

---

### 4. 📊 Logging & Monitoring
- Centralized logging system with a live **Mirror Log Viewer App**.
- Generates detailed log files for **audit and debugging**.
- Enables **transparency** and **performance review**.

---

### 5. 📈 Data Feed

- Supplies the **Algo** and **Manual Order Management** modules for strategy optimization.

---

### 6. 💻 Front-End Applications

#### Mirror Trading Manager App
- Dashboard for managing accounts, trade routing, and performance metrics.

#### Diagram Overview Map Editor App
- Visual editor to map accounts, connections, and strategies.
